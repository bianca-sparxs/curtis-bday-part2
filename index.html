                    since at work, i used docker once (and understood it), i had to do it again. all i did was 
                    make a dockerfile to pull the nginx image that serves this static page. After that I 
                    take this really simple image I made to AWS (ECS, EC2, i don't really know) where they host on a 
                    public IP for (for moneys unfotunately) This was like really simple to do, i know i could have 
                    used s3 but likkkeeee... <b>docker tho</b>. such an improvement from 
                    last year <i>*rolls eyes*</i>. don't judge the design, i know it sucks lol.
                    I hope you got some degree of amusement out of this! I know I did when curating these.
